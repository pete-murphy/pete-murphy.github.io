      <article class="post"><p>There are many paths to Functional Programming Land, and an
embarrassment of riches when it comes to learning materials. I’ve tried
my best to hand-pick out some of the better ones I’ve come across and
categorize them according to a given starting point or “use case”. I’ve
also tried to sort each section by how easy or accessible they are to
beginners. I’m by no means an expert on any of this stuff—I’m still
early on on the learning curve myself—but I’ve at least attempted most
of the tutorials listed and what I lack in expertise I’ll try my best to
make up for in empathy. So if you find you could use some guidance or
help getting through any of the material, I’m happy to help.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-functional-programming">What is Functional
Programming?</h2>
<p>Before assuming that you want to learn FP, it may help to get an
inkling as to what it is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FP is just programming with functions. Functions are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Total: They return an output for every input.</li>
<li>Deterministic: They return the same output for the same input.</li>
<li>Pure: Their only effect is computing the output.</li>
</ol>
<p>The rest is just composition you can learn over time.</p>
<div style="text-align:right;">
– <em>John De Goes</em>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>While that’s true enough, it might not be quite enough to get you
started. Here are a few bird’s-eye overview talks/presentations that I
think are helpful or that I’ve heard recommended:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-5obm1G_FY">Learning
Functional Programming with JavaScript</a> by Anjana Vakil. A quick,
informal presentation of some functional concepts in JS such as
functional purity, array methods, immutability and persistent data
structures, from a beginner’s perspective.</li>
<li><a href="https://soundcloud.com/lambda-cast">LambdaCast</a> “The
podcast about learning functional programming from the perspective of a
working developer.” Hosted by David Koontz and a handful of guests with
varying degrees of functional programming knowledge—I found it very
helpful to have a complete beginner’s perspective represented in the
discussion. I’d recommend the first episode or two to start, but the
series as a whole serves as a good companion to learning these
concepts.</li>
<li><a
href="https://www.functionalgeekery.com/episode-61-susan-potter/">Susan
Potter on <em>Functional Geekery</em></a> (Jump to about the 5:15 mark
to skip the sponsor plugs.) About Susan’s transition from “smug OOP”
systems programmer in Java/C++ to embracing Erlang and Haskell and the
benefits of the abstractions that functional programming has afforded
her. Some of it is over my head but maybe useful for those coming from
similar background to hers.</li>
<li><a href="https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/fppatterns/">Functional
Design Patterns</a> by Scott Wlaschin. Covers much of the same material,
but if you’re anything like me you’ll benefit from hearing/reading these
things explained more than one way.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="learning-functional-programming-in-javascript">Learning
Functional Programming in JavaScript</h2>
<p>So you’re sold on FP as a worthwhile paradigm and you know a bit of
JavaScript, how do you get started with functional JS?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB1ZC7czKRs">JavaScript30:
Array Cardio</a> with Wes Bos. This whole course is a good JavaScript
tutorial series, and Wes is good at being entertaining and engaging. I’d
recommend this tutorial in particular as a solid introduction to “the
gateway drug(s) to functional programming”: the array methods of map,
filter, sort, reduce. Plus he has exercises to work through which is
key.</li>
<li><a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMUiFMZr7vk&amp;list=PL0zVEGEvSaeEd9hlmCXrk5yUyqUag-n84">FunFunFunction:
FP in JS</a> (another YouTube series) with MPJ. Stick with the first
four episodes for a more in-depth exploration of JS array methods.</li>
<li><a
href="https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/functional-programming">FreeCodeCamp</a>
has a whole section on functional JS if you want to test your knowledge.
The instant gratification that comes with completing a passing test is
👌. A good challenge to set for yourself is to try to get through as
much of the <a
href="https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/intermediate-algorithm-scripting">algorithms</a>
problem set as you can without using a <code>for</code>-loop.</li>
<li><a
href="https://mostly-adequate.gitbooks.io/mostly-adequate-guide/"><em>Professor
Frisby’s Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming</em></a> by
Brian Lonsdorf (aka Dr Boolean). I <strong><em>strongly</em></strong>
recommend this one, above and beyond all functional JS guides, once
you’re comfortable enough with the language. Manipulating arrays is
great and all, and sometimes very useful, but if you want to get deeper
into implementing some functional patterns this is your ticket.</li>
<li><a
href="https://egghead.io/courses/professor-frisby-introduces-composable-functional-javascript"><em>Professor
Frisby Introduces Composable Functional JavaScript</em></a> from same
author. This is a stop-motion video series featuring woodland creatures
in a classroom setting, all while managing to be very educational. It
does start a bit in the deep end, but coding along and re-watching a few
times are rewarded.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.tomharding.me/fantasy-land/">Fantas, Eel, and
Specification</a> by Tom Harding. A series of blog posts that have
proved quite popular though I haven’t (<em>yet</em>) worked my way
through all of them. In the author’s words, it’s a series “in vanilla
JS, going through everything you’d need to know to be a Haskell
programmer.”</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="learning-a-functional-programming-language">Learning a
Functional Programming Language</h2>
<p>If you really want to go all-in 🏊🏼‍♀️ and make the deep dive into a
purely-functional, statically-typed language, then I welcome you to come
along with me!</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><a href="http://haskellbook.com"><em>Haskell Programming from First
Principles</em></a> (or <em>Haskell Book</em> for short) by Chris Allen
and Julie Moronuki. This is a <em>very</em> long book (I’m currently
only 2/3 of the way through after over two months), but it starts from
absolute beginner-level and follows a very principled and
well-researched approach to learning the language.</li>
<li><a
href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/%7Ecis194/spring13/lectures.html">Brent
Yorgey’s CIS 194 course</a> Recommended as the best <em>free</em>
resource for learning Haskell (if you don’t want to buy <em>Haskell
Book</em>).</li>
<li><a href="https://leanpub.com/purescript/read"><em>PureScript by
Example</em></a> by Phil Freeman, the author of the PureScript language.
Very much Haskell-inspired, so I’ve heard it recommended to get familiar
with the concepts and syntax of Haskell first, since there are more
resources for learning the latter.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="learning-the-lambda-calculus">Learning the Lambda Calculus</h2>
<p>All functional programming languages have at their root the lambda
calculus invented (or <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOiZatlZtGU&amp;t=1345s"><em>discovered?</em></a>)
by Alonzo Church in the 1930s. This is a subject worthy of study in its
own right, but starting to think in terms of the abstractions involved
in combinatory logic can be a very powerful exercise. I think the best
introduction I’ve found was in the first chapter of <em>Haskell
Book</em>, but since that is not freely available, I’ve tried to find
some alternative resources. A lot of these tutorials cover the same
material in different media and with different approaches; I’ve found
that it usually takes a repeated exposure to the concepts presented in a
variety of ways before I finally start to develop an intuition.</p>

Calculus (Computerphile video)</a> with Prof Graham Hutton. A perhaps
too-quick run-through of the fundamentals, but he offers a good beginner
challenge: implement the logical <code>AND</code> operator
(<code>&amp;&amp;</code> in JavaScript) and the logical <code>OR</code>
operator (<code>||</code>) in terms of the lambda calculus.</li>
